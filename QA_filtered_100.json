According to the HUAWEI nova Y70 User Guide.pdf (pp. 21–24), Huawei's \"Multi-Device Collaboration\" (also called Device+) is designed for use within the Huawei ecosystem (e.g., Huawei phones, tablets, Vision smart screens).\\n2. According to the MacBook Air (2008) User Manual.pdf (pp. 15–16), its built-in wireless sharing functions mainly rely on AirPort (Wi-Fi) to share DVDs/CDs or migrate data between Macs or Windows computers, but it does not support direct collaboration protocols with Android systems."
